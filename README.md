System Analysis and Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
What did you do particularly well?

The client throughout this project is DriverPass. DriverPass is owned by Liam and the IT officer is Ian. The owenr of DriverPass identified and issue that DriverPass is aiming to fix. The issue at hand is people are failing their driving test at the DMV and there is a Demand for better driver training. DriverPass wants to increase the passing rate of students taking their Driver License test at the DMV by providing the students with the proper preparation for the exam with online classes, practice tests, and on-the-road-training. They intend to bring their vision to fruition by creating a system to allow students to make reservations for driving lessons, allow students/faculty to access their system while they are online/offline, provide faculty with the authority to reset passwords and block employee access to their system after employee has resigned, and lasty keep a record of who made/rescheduled/canceled an appointment. Throughout the project what I did particularly well was understanding what the requirements of the client are by reviewing the meeting trancript and using it as a refrence. 
 
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

The section of the document that I would revise would be the limitations. The limitations can be explained with more detail. Unfortenatly, we were given limited information about the projects limitations which is why the explanations in this section are vague. If possible I would review the document first and determine what needs more information from the meeting trancript to rrequest from the client. This will allow me to obtain a more detailed description of what limitation the project will have and will not base the limitations on assumptions for the project budget. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The users needs were interpreted by putting myself in their shoes to understand what they would need and want in the system. The users needs were also determined by what the problem and solution was to passing DMV driving tests. This provided me to understand what the user can use and benefit from when accessing the system. The users were needs were also determined based on the ease of accessibility of the systems tools. The login page would contain all their learning methods within a glance for them to obtain and learn DMV policies and rules. The owner also had needs that were stated in the trasncript of the meeting. These needs were made into requirements in the project document to ensure that they would be implemented. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

The approach I would take for designig the software would be determining what the requirements are and documenting it for myself and the client. The client will be presented with the document of the project that contains the goals, requirements, and limitations of the project. If the client signs off on the document the SDLC is initiated and the developement process will begin by using the document as a layout to guide me when creating the code. The technique that I would implement in the future to analyze and design a system is conducting interviews with a client or reading the documented transcirpt of the project to understand what needs to get created. This will allow me to understand what the requirments are for the project and avoid guessing what is a requirement and a suggestion for the project.
